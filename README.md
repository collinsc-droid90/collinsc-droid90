# Hi, I'm Chrisanni 👋

## Portfolio
At the moment, I'm enrolled in CSC-113 AI Fundamentals and discovering how to work alongside AI tools!

## Passion Project 🎯
Since my childhood, I've always had a love for drawing. While I'm good at both, I ultimately lean towards digital art rather than traditional.

## Work In Progress (WIPs)
- 🤖 Collaborating with AI and crafting prompts
- 🐙 Utilizing GitHub workflows and managing version control
- 💡 Creating my initial AI assistants

## Hidden Gem
I lived in Germany for two years (it was life-changing).

## Find Me
- 📫 Right here on GitHub!
